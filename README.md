Making Matplotlib Magic
It's been a few days since you sent your box plot to the senior scientist at Pymaceuticals. Today, they finally got back to you with feedback. They said that your initial box plot was fantastic! In fact, with a few tweaks, your visualization can be used in a publication. Thankfully, with Jupyter Notebook, adding more content to your Matplotlib visualizations will be straightforward.

For this assignment, you’ll use the same drug regimen data that you used earlier along with Matplotlib subplots to create an advanced visualization that’s packed with insightful information.
